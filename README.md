You Should Ask Yourself This Question When You Mess Up:

Look, we all mess up. We take certain people or clients for granted and a relationship deteriorates. We get distracted and make an unnecessary mistake. 
We are overwhelmed by a passion or a temper and do something bad.
We‚Äôre humans. It happens.

What follows are consequences. The client leaves us. The mistake costs money to repair. An apology turns out to be insufficient.
And what follows consequences is often regret, and sometimes shame. Or, if we are less self-aware, anger and blame. We mope. We whine. We wish things were otherwise, 
we wish we weren‚Äôt such pieces of shit. If only we had just‚Ä¶

This sort of self-flagellation is not what Life is about. It‚Äôs backward looking‚Äìthe worst, most purposeless kind of personal evaluation. Instead, when we mess up, 
and when we come face to face with the consequences of our actions, we must ask: What can I learn from this?

Literally, we can ask that to the client who is leaving us (What can I do better next time? What warning signs did I miss?). We can look at our habits and 
study where we got distracted and made that boneheaded mistake. We can look at the payoff we got from that passionate indulgence and examine whether it was worth the costs.
And in so doing, we can learn from the past, without reliving it on a loop.

We should look at every action and ask, ‚ÄúWhy are they doing that?‚Äù
And who does we should start with? With ourselves.

It‚Äôs inevitable that you will do wrong. You may even mess something up five minutes after reading this post. What matters, is not the mistakes‚Äîparticularly 
simple errors that are a fact of life‚Äìbut what we do about them. What matters is what lessons emerge from the missteps, and how we improve because of them. How we fix or make up for them.
Because that‚Äôs all we can do.
